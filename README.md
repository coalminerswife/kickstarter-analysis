# Kickstarting With Excel

## Overview of Project
The overall objective of this project was to become comfortable with the tool provided by Microsoft Excel to analyze data and use visual aids to help us better understand what the data is telling us. The data use was pulled from a previous set of kickstart campaigns for all different types of media projects. 

### Purpose
The specific purpose in relation to the data in the data set was to analyze previous outcomes of kickstarters for "plays" by outcome based on launch date and outcome based on the plays' fundraising goal on kickstarter so that we could give better insight to our client on how she should approach launching a kickstarter for her own play. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I encountered two challenges in creating the pivot tables and charts needed to visualize our findings. The first was on the "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" pivot table where I could not figure out how to change the row value to show a range of months instead of years/quarters. After playing around a little bit with the different tools and dropped down menu I found the format cells selection and was able to change data type to "date" for the row labels. 

The second challenge I faced was learning how to properly format the line graph on the Outcomes Based on Goals plot of data. I kept playing around with the formulas in the select data option before realizing I was making it too complicated for myself and I could simply remove all the different columns I did not want in the graph by using the "-" button underneath the legend series header. After doing this my graph was formatted correctly.

# Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis?
Conclusion I: The first conclusion drawn from the line graph of data for plays kickstarters is that there is a significant jump from successful campaigns in between the months of April and May with the amount reaching a peak value of 111 successful kickstarters launched in May. While there is also a small jump in failures over the same time period the size of the increase is not the same as it is with the successful kickstarters. This could suggest that the population the kickstarter is geared towards has more free time and money to spend as the summer months kick off. 

Conclusion II: After the month of May there is a consistent drop in the numbers until the month of October where it rises slightly, perhaps indicating that as school and work has kicked back into gear people are reintroduced to each other after summer and that energy generates a slight increase in donations at the start. As we proceed into the fall and winter months there is a noticeable decline in successful campaigns launched. This would suggest that if our client were to start her campaign she should aim for the month of May and really should start it no later than the month of June.
